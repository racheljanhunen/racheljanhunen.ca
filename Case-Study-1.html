          <h4 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-5">The Challenge</h4>
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-6"> When Borealis Wind installs their system within wind turbines, the control system must be
commissioned, which refers to the process of bringing the system to a working condition. The
commissioning process was initially completed by the Borealis Wind engineering team, however
with company growth, employees will be hired on to be responsible for installation and
commissioning. Currently, commissioning takes place by accessing the code used to program the
IPS. It is not good practice to allow people outside of the core engineering team to have access to
this code, as this can compromise the company’s patented design and security of the system.
Therefore, a way to complete the commissioning process through a user interface, without requiring
access to the code, is necessary.&nbsp;</p>

          <h4 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-9">Requirements Gathering</h4>
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-10">In order to formulate the requirements for the interface, research methods were employed. First, discussion with the engineering team took place, to understand what problems had come up in the past.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>Next, informal interviews were held with wind farm technicians, to obtain their insight into desires for an interface design. After, a survey was designed for the site installation team at Borealis Wind, which included questions like, "what has been the most frustrating aspect when commissioning task X".&nbsp;<br>
            <br>Once all of the design requests were gathered, a weighted decision matrix was used to narrow down the list. Three criteria were utilized, being the frequency of the problem that the solution addresses, the time required to do the initial method, and the value for troubleshooting the system. By completing these weights within an engineering team meeting, the final list of functional requirements was formulated.

          <h4 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-black u-text-default u-text-11">Scope</h4>
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-12"> The project scope was first defined by outlining usability metrics, to be used to evaluate the final design. These metrics were proposed to the engineering team, and were finalized to be:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Effective</span>
            <br>The effectiveness of the commissioning UI shall not be less than 80%.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Satisfying</span>
            <br>The commissioning UI shall have an overall single ease question (SEQ) score
							of at least 5.9.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Error Tolerant</span>
            <br>The commissioning UI shall reflect 100% of configured values for the
							user to confirm that values have been successfully changed&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Easy to Learn</span>
            <br>Users will be able to use the commissioning UI while consulting the user
							manual for 20% of tasks.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Efficient</span>
            <br>Users will be able to navigate to desired locations of the commissioning UI
							within 60 seconds.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Usable</span>
            <br>The system usability scale (SUS) for the commissioning UI shall have a score of at least 70.<br>
            <br>As well, functional requirements for what the commissioning UI must include were defined, through the process outlined above. These requirements included aspects such as allowing configurability of various variables, displaying system outputs, and showing system errors.<br>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-14">To optimize the navigation of the interface, a few key practices were considered. First, given the large amount of information to be featured in this interface, pagination was proposed, to improve organization and legibility. These additional pages will be accessed through buttons on the main page, which will be spaced out and large, for ease of accessibility. A hover state will be implemented, to identify call-to-action areas. Lastly, back buttons will be incorporated on each page, in order to return to the main page.</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-16">A low fidelity wireframe was mocked up, to get a sense of the overall layout. Six screens were created, being the main menu, a global variables page, a sensor data page, a heater data page, PLC outputs page, and&nbsp; a page for blade feedback variables.</p>
          <img class="u-align-center u-image u-image-contain u-image-default u-image-1" src="images/ScreenShot2022-06-08at1.58.11PM.png" alt="" data-image-width="1600" data-image-height="736">
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-17">From here, a medium fidelity wireframe was created in Figma. The focus of this wireframe was on location of pieces of information, format of design features, and emphasis on call-to-action areas. This stage also allowed for implementation of interface design best practices.&nbsp;Interaction design was explored through means of Fitt's law. Fitt's law was implemented by utilizing the edges of the screen to house the "back" and "logout" buttons for the design.&nbsp; Visual design was implemented to create an effective user interface design, through the implementation of hierarchy. This was done through the use of bigger fonts for page titles and section headings, and smaller fonts for instructions and page information.</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-19">With the creation of a medium-fidelity wireframe, a testing session was held with 3 of the engineering team members. The wireframes were shown, explained, and then feedback was given. The Neilsen Norman Group Usability Heuristics were used to classify the changes that needed to be made. This feedback was:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Recognition rather than recall:&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Include the turbine number on the main page, so that the user is not required to remember which turbine they are working on.</span>
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Error prevention:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> The testing mode switch should be included on testing-specific pages, rather than the main page, to avoid switching pages while in testing mode.</span>

            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Consistency and standards:<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Configuration variables should be displayed in the order of the commissioning process, to avoid user confusion.</span>

          <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-25">To analyze the usability requirements, performance testing was used. A sample size of 3, including individuals with varying commissioning experience, was recruited. First, each individual read through a commissioning manual, to get a sense of how the interface worked. A series of 6 tasks was completed by each of the users on the final prototype. The task time, success rate, manual consultation, values reflected, and SEQ response were recorded after each task. At the end of the testing session, each user completed the SUS response.<br>
            <br>The results from the testing were averaged, and it was found that:<br>

          <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-28"> The results from the validation of the functional requirements were that each of the requirements performed at a 100% success rate. As well, each of the usability requirements were met. Going forward, it would be beneficial to recruit more users for usability testing, to get the most accurate representation for test results. This could not be completed during my time at Borealis Wind, but would be a recommendation for continued project development.<br>
            <br>With the design of this commissioning interface, the code does not need to be consulted during the commissioning process. This leads to an increased opportunity for business growth, as commissioning can be done by commissioning-specific personnel, and the engineering team can focus on design work. Final remarks from the engineering team, after a presentation of the solution, were those of high satisfaction.<br>
