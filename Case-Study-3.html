The designed solution includes an interface designed for a tablet, and a device to monitor sleep patterns. The development of this project took place with a design team at the University of Waterloo.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-4"> The roles I had in this design were largely in user research and usability testing. I was responsible for conducting user research to develop personas, and information architecture testing on the interface prototype.&nbsp;</p>

          <h4 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-5">The Challenge</h4>
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-6"> Within the community of those who have&nbsp;dementia, a large portion suffer from disrupted sleep. The disruption to sleep leads to an irregular sleep schedule, causing agitation, restlessness, and increased sleeping during the day. At night, this can lead to sleep apnea, calling out to caretakers, and wandering around. The disturbance to sleep negatively affects the caretaker of someone with dementia, as they are required to react to their changing needs and monitor safety through the night.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>Thus, a need exists for a solution that allows for the caretaker to better anticipate how the person that they are caring for will behave based on the sleep they obtained.

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-8"> The primary user of the designed device is the caretaker of a person with dementia. Caretakers can be family members,&nbsp;personal support workers, and nurses. The caretaker will be the user that is most often interacting with the developed product, and are who the product is centred around.<br>
            <br>The secondary user would be the person with dementia, as they interact with the device part of the time, specifically when it comes to monitoring sleep.

          <h4 class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-black u-text-default u-text-9">Scope</h4>
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-10"> To further define the scope of the project, the intended user for the final solution is primarily the caretaker, with occasional interactions with the person with dementia. The solution is also intended to be used within the place of residence of the person with dementia. Usability goals were determined, in order to assess the final product, which were:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Effective to use<br>
            </span>The user must be able to detect nighttime wandering with minimal disruption to their sleep. To record this, the false alarm rate of the device shall be measured.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Efficient to use </span>
            <br>The user must find that navigation of the device is instinctive. To record this, task completion rate of various navigation-related tasks will be measured.<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Easy to learn</span>
            <br> The user must be able to find the device to be intuitive, and not require much additional documentation to use it. To record this, the length it takes to complete various tasks (task time) will be measured.<br>
            <br>As well, user experience goals were developed, to centre the design process around the feelings of the user. The goals were:<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Convenient</span>
            <br>Users should feel like using the device is convenient to their daily lifestyle<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Reliable</span>
            <br>Users should feel like the device is reliable in alerting them when the person with dementia is wandering throughout the night<br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Helpful</span>
            <br>Users should feel as though the device is helping them in their caretaking abilities

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-12"> The first step in addressing this problem space was to understand the users. I developed proto-personas for both the caretaker and the person with dementia, to allow for the team to have an introductory understanding of who we were designing for. Next, I utilized secondary research, interviews with users, and the modified fly-on-the-wall technique to develop research based personas. The finalized personas, with information that came from research techniques outlined in colour, are shown below.</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-14"> Figma was utilized to develop a prototype of the user interface. Popular interface designs were assessed, and interface design principles were implemented to achieve the design. A dark colour scheme was implemented, as this is a platform that correlates with sleep. Pagination was also utilized, to spread content across a few tabs, decreasing the amount of information that the user must take in at once.</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-15">The first screen displays the sleep pattern from the previous night, the overall quality of the sleep from the previous night, and the behaviours to expect based on the sleep quality.</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-16">The second screen displays further suggestions for the user regarding how to better care for the person with dementia. This includes the expectations for behaviour and suggestions on how to provide better care.&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-17">The third screen displays the sleep history from previous nights, including the number of nights being averaged for, the average time slept, and the average quality. This gives better insight for the caretaker into what the sleep statistics are.</p>
          <img class="u-align-center-lg u-align-center-md u-align-center-sm u-align-center-xs u-image u-image-default u-image-6" src="images/ScreenShot2021-01-18at6.47.45PM.png" alt="" data-image-width="1600" data-image-height="945">
          <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-18">The final screen displays information, medical history, and the emergency contact for the person with dementia.

          <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-20"> Following the development of the prototyped user interface, I conducted testing on the information architecture through the form of Tree Testing. A Treejack was created, with 3 different tasks that required users to navigate through the information architecture. Seven users were recruited to take part in testing, and the results for each of the tasks can be seen below.</p>
          <img class="u-align-center u-image u-image-contain u-image-default u-image-7" src="images/ScreenShot2021-01-18at10.31.02PM.png" alt="" data-image-width="2548" data-image-height="1230">

      </div>
      <div class="u-container-style u-expanded-width u-group u-palette-5-light-3 u-group-9">
        <div class="u-container-layout u-container-layout-9">
          <h4 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-text-21">Outcomes</h4>
          <p class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-22"> The results from the tree testing were that task 1 is the most successful in terms of the ability for users to find information. Task 2 was not successful in this area, and task 3 was the least successful. The data suggests that care should be taken in the redesign of the information architecture of tasks 2 and 3 specifically. Due to time limitations on the project's deliverable, redesign could not take place. Tree testing does an excellent job of testing the usability goals, specifically the efficient to use and easy to use goals. Based on task completion rate, task 1 meets the efficient to use goal, whereas task 2 and 3 do not. In terms of task time, the quickest time to complete was task 2 with task 3, and 1 following behind. This evaluates the easy to learn goal, with task 2 being the easiest to learn, and task 1 being the least. This design project taught the importance of user centred design, and the necessity of user testing.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>If this project were continued, more user testing would be conducted, specifically on the user interface itself, to gain a deeper understanding of the usability. Then, appropriate care could be taken to developing another prototype of the interface design.
